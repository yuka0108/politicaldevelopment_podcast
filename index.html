                content_en: `Hello everyone, and welcome to our course! Before we jump into the content, I want to take a few minutes to talk about something very important — all those little worries you might have in your mind. Trust me, you’re not alone, and yes, your teacher gets it. First of all, many of you may be thinking, “What if my English isn’t good enough?” Let me make one thing clear: this class is taught in English, but it is not an English class. If the class is not meant to test your language, and if the goal is to share ideas, then the conclusion is simple: your thoughts matter more than perfect grammar. Mistakes are not failures — they are proof that you are trying. And trying is how learning begins! Some of you might say, “But I feel nervous speaking English.” Of course you do! That’s normal. When something is unfamiliar, we feel anxious. When we practice, it becomes familiar. And when it becomes familiar, the fear slowly fades away. So the logic is clear: the more you speak, the more confident you become. Give yourself that chance. No one here will laugh at you. Now, about writing English essays — scary, right? Well, take a deep breath. Lawrence will explain the format and requirements carefully. You may also use AI tools in an appropriate way, as long as you tell us how you use them. If you have guidance and support, and if you have tools to help, then the conclusion is this: you are not doing this alone. What about background knowledge? Maybe you think, “I don’t know much about politics. My ideas might be bad.” But listen to this: that is exactly why this class exists. If learning starts from not knowing, and if this course is designed to help you build understanding, then the conclusion is obvious: you don’t need to be an expert to belong here. And for exchange or non-local students — your different cultural perspectives are not a weakness. They are a gift to this classroom. Some of you may worry about understanding academic or political English. That’s okay too. If something is new, it takes time to understand. If it takes time, then asking questions is part of the process. So please, ask anytime. I’ll be happy to explain more, slow down, or talk after class. Emails in Chinese or English are both welcome. Finally, GPA and group work. You might worry about finding teammates or about your grades. Let me reassure you: groups will be arranged, and no one will be left out. Grades reflect effort, not just results. If you try your best, we will see it. And we will support you. So let me end with this: you don’t have to be great at the beginning. You just have to be willing to begin. This course is the place where we grow together. Alright — are you ready? Let’s get started!`,
                content_zh: `各位同學大家好，歡迎來到我們的課程！在正式開始之前，我想先跟大家聊聊一件很重要的事——沒錯，就是你們心裡那些「我會不會不行啊？」的小擔心。放心，你不是一個人，我都懂。首先，很多人會擔心：「我英文不好怎麼辦？」來，老師先跟你說清楚一件事：我們是用英文上課，但我們不是在上英文課。所以前提一成立——這不是語言測驗；前提二是——學習的重點在內容；結論就是：你不需要完美英文，也能在這堂課學得很好！說錯沒關係，敢說、願意說，才是真正重要的事。那再來，有人會想：「可是我一開口就緊張啊！」對，緊張很正常，因為你在做一件不熟悉、但很有價值的事。既然緊張來自不熟，那只要多練就會變熟；既然變熟就會減少緊張；所以結論很簡單——給自己機會開口，你一定會進步！而且我保證，這裡沒有人會笑你。第三個，寫英文 essay 會不會很可怕？先深呼吸！之後 Lawrence 會清楚說明格式和要求，你也可以適度使用 AI 幫忙，只要記得誠實說明怎麼用。前提是有清楚指引，前提是有工具可用，那結論就是：你不是孤軍奮戰。還有人會說：「老師，我沒有政治背景耶，我的想法會不會很遜？」我反而要說，這正是你來這堂課最好的理由！因為如果你已經都會了，你還需要來學嗎？前提是課程是為了學習；前提是學習從不會開始；所以結論是：你現在不懂，完全沒有問題！交換生、非本地生更是如此，你們的文化觀點，會讓討論變得更精彩。那如果你聽不太懂學術英文或政治術語呢？別擔心。聽不懂代表你正在接觸新東西；接觸新東西就需要時間；所以結論是——問就對了！老師會多解釋、也會放慢速度，你下課後、寄信問，中英文都可以。最後，有人會焦慮 GPA，或怕找不到組員。來，老師再說一次：分組會協助安排，沒有人會被丟下；成績看的是努力，不只是結果。既然你願意投入，我們就會陪你走到最後。所以同學們，總結一句話：你不需要現在就很厲害，你只需要願意開始。這堂課，就是我們一起變厲害的地方。準備好了嗎？那我們就出發吧！`

                title_en: "Concepts & Legitimacy",
                title_zh: "第二週：概念與合法性",
                content_en: `Alright, let’s go back to what we covered on week 2. This lecture is really about one thing: getting you to realize that many political terms you take for granted are actually far less stable than they seem. Let’s start with a basic question: what is a concept? In political science, a concept is an abstract idea without a fixed definition. This is not a weakness — it’s exactly what makes concepts useful. Politics changes, so concepts have to be flexible. Take democracy as an example. Most people would agree that the United States is a democratic country. But China also claims that it is democratic. So here’s the problem: if two very different political systems can both use the same word, where is the issue? The answer is not simply that one side is lying. It’s that the concept of democracy itself is fluid. Concepts adjust to context. When the Chinese Communist Party describes its system as “Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,” it is not rejecting socialism. It is redefining it. This shows why concepts are powerful in politics: they are flexible enough to be imported, adapted, and implemented in very different settings. Next, legitimacy. Legitimacy is not about legality; it’s about trust. Do people accept the government, and why? There are four main ways governments build that trust. One is fair and clean elections. Another is good performance — but this is risky, because no government can perform well forever. When performance declines, legitimacy can quickly be questioned, as we’ve seen recently in Indonesia and Nepal. A third source is a leader’s charisma, which usually does not last long. The fourth is identifying enemies. During national crises, people often unite against a common enemy, even if they dislike the government or its leaders. So here’s something to think about: if a government has no elections and only average performance, but still enjoys public support, does it have legitimacy? Then we move to leftists and rightists. Leftists tend to support change, new values such as diversity, equality, and inclusion, and they prioritize collective interests. They believe the government should play an active role in managing the economy and caring for society. Rightists are generally more conservative. They emphasize tradition, individualism, capitalism, and free markets, and they prefer minimal government intervention. This is not about which side is morally correct. It’s about different value priorities. That leads us to protectionism. Protectionism refers to policies that restrict imports in order to protect domestic industries, usually through tariffs or quotas. The goal is to make imported goods more expensive and support local jobs. However, in practice, these costs are often passed on to consumers, raising prices not only for imports but sometimes for domestic products as well. Finally, let’s look at recent social changes. Historically, countries with high levels of immigration tended to lean left. Today, however, growing skepticism toward globalization has pushed many societies to focus more on national interests, leading to a shift toward the right. Brexit is a clear example. Alright, we’ll stop here for now. You don’t need to settle on answers yet. Just remember to pause the next time you hear these concepts and ask yourself how, and why, they are being used.`,
                content_zh: `好，我們來回到第二周的這堂課。這一堂課其實在做一件事，就是帶你開始理解：政治學裡，很多你以為很穩定的詞，其實一點都不穩定。我們先從一個最基本的問題開始：什麼是概念？在政治學裡，概念是一種抽象的想法，而且通常沒有一個「標準答案式」的定義。這不是因為學者懶，而是因為政治本身就在變動。概念如果太死，就用不了。舉一個大家最熟的例子，民主。美國是民主國家，這點多數人不會反對；但中國也宣稱自己是民主國家。那問題來了——如果這兩個制度差這麼多，卻都能用同一個詞，問題出在哪？答案通常不是「誰比較誠實」，而是：民主這個概念本身就具有流動性。概念會依照脈絡被重新定義、重新包裝。中國共產黨說自己的制度是「中國特色社會主義」，並不是說它不用社會主義這個概念，而是它重新設定了這個概念的標準。這正好說明一件事：概念之所以有力量，是因為它夠模糊，能被不同國家「拿去用」。接下來是合法性。合法性不是在問合不合法，而是在問：人民信不信你。那政府怎麼讓人民相信它？大致有四種方式。第一，公平而且沒有貪腐的民主選舉。第二，良好的施政表現。但這一種其實風險很高，因為沒有任何政府可以保證自己永遠表現良好。一旦表現下滑，合法性就會開始被質疑，最近印尼和尼泊爾的情況就是很好的觀察點。第三，領導人的個人魅力。不過這種魅力通常不耐久。第四，樹立敵人。在國家危機時，人們很容易因為「對抗共同敵人」而團結起來，甚至願意支持一個他們平常並不喜歡的政府。那這裡我想你停一下，想一個問題：如果一個政府沒有選舉、表現也只是普通，但人民仍然支持它，這樣算不算有合法性？再來談左派與右派。左派通常偏好改變，支持新的價值觀，例如多元、平等與包容，也比較重視集體利益，認為政府應該更積極介入經濟與社會，照顧人民。右派則相對保守，重視傳統、個人主義與資本主義，傾向支持自由市場，認為政府最好少干預。這不是對錯問題，而是價值選擇的問題。講到這裡，就會自然連到保護主義。保護主義是政府限制進口、保護國內產業的經濟政策，例如透過關稅或配額。目的很清楚，就是讓進口商品變貴，鼓勵大家買國產貨、保護本地工作機會。但現實往往是，這些成本最後會轉嫁到消費者身上，不只進口商品變貴，連國內商品也可能一起漲價。所以問題從來不是「保護主義好不好」，而是：你願不願意為它付出代價。最後，把這些放到近幾年的社會變化來看。過去，高移民國家往往比較偏左；但現在，越來越多人對全球化感到懷疑，開始更關注自己的國家與邊界，政治立場也慢慢往右移。英國脫歐就是一個很典型的例子。好，我們今天就先停在這裡。你現在不用急著下判斷，但下次再聽到這些詞的時候，記得多問一句：這個概念，是在什麼情況下被誰用來說明什麼事情。`

                week: 3,
                title_en: "Ideology, Liberty, & Fragility",
                title_zh: "第三週：意識形態、自由與脆弱性",
                content_en: `Week 3 – Ideology, Liberty, and the Fragility of Democracy. Alright, today let’s start with something that sounds simple, but really isn’t. We often talk about -isms in politics—liberalism, socialism, communism—as if they were clearly defined boxes. But the truth is, all of these are ideologies, and ideology itself is already a slippery thing. So what is an ideology? At its core, it’s a systematic set of ideas about what the world should look like. And notice the word should. That’s where the problem begins. Because once we talk about “should,” we’re no longer describing reality—we’re making normative claims. And like most concepts in political science, ideology never has one definition that everyone agrees on. Let’s take liberalism as an example. Liberalism is built on the idea of liberty: everyone should enjoy the maximum possible freedom, as long as it doesn’t infringe on the freedom of others. Sounds reasonable, right? But very quickly, we run into questions. Think about everyday behavior. In China, it’s common to see people watching videos out loud on the subway. In Taiwan, it happens less often. In Japan, social norms are so strong that phones are expected to be on manner mode. So here’s the question: whose liberty matters more—the individual’s, or everyone else’s? And once you open that door, harder questions follow. Is mercy killing part of liberty? What about the right to own a gun? Liberalism doesn’t give you easy answers. It gives you a framework—and then leaves you uncomfortable. Now add meritocracy into the picture. The idea sounds fair: rewards should go to those with talent and effort. But here’s a line worth sitting with: If you truly believe people deserve their success, you also truly believe people deserve their suffering. That’s not an attack—it’s a logical implication. This leads us to equality. Liberal systems often claim to treat everyone equally: open competition, equal rules, neutral institutions. But is it reasonable to treat people equally when they are born with very unequal forms of capital—economic, social, cultural? Pierre Bourdieu would tell us that pretending these differences don’t exist doesn’t make society fair; it just makes inequality harder to see. Now let’s shift to communism and socialism. In theory, socialism is a transitional stage toward a communist utopia. In communism, there is no free market, because competition produces inequality. Money loses its meaning, and everyone is equal—at least on paper. Many countries claim this identity: China, Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea. Whether they actually match the theory is another question entirely. Let’s ground this discussion with something concrete: taxes. In Sweden, income tax can reach 60 to 70 percent. In Taiwan, the maximum is about 30 percent, and most locals pay far less. Yet the Taiwanese government is relatively wealthy—thanks to profit taxes, consumption taxes, state-owned assets like TSMC, and high tariffs. These are political choices, rooted in ideology, not accidents. Now, what about democracy? We often treat it as a yes-or-no label, but that’s misleading. Instead, think of democracy as having dimensions: elections, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, freedom of relationships. Even these are regulated. Germany restricts Nazi speech. China restricts movement through the household registration system. Every system draws lines somewhere. Finally, let’s talk about developmentalism. The idea that economic growth comes first, and everything else comes later. Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong—all followed this path, and it worked economically. But here’s the uncomfortable question: should democracy wait until people are fed? Some argue yes—because democracy without state capacity is fragile. Others argue that postponing democracy risks never getting it at all. And even the rise of a middle class doesn’t guarantee democratization. Wealth doesn’t protest by itself. People do. So I’ll stop here, not with an answer, but with a question. When you hear words like freedom, equality, or democracy, the real issue isn’t whether they sound good. It’s who gets to define them—and when.`,
                content_zh: `第 3 週：意識形態、自由，以及民主的脆弱性。好，今天我們先從一個看起來很基本、但其實一點也不簡單的問題開始。政治裡有很多 -ism，自由主義、社會主義、共產主義，我們常常把它們當成已經定義好的分類。但事實上，它們全部都是意識形態，而意識形態本身，就已經很難被清楚定義。那什麼是意識形態？簡單說，它是一套系統性的想法，告訴我們這個世界「應該」長什麼樣子。重點就在「應該」這兩個字。因為一旦談到應該，我們談的就不再是事實，而是價值判斷。而在政治學裡，價值幾乎永遠不會只有一種版本。以自由主義為例。自由主義對「自由」的理解是：每個人都應該擁有最大的自由，但不能侵犯他人的自由。這聽起來很合理，但問題馬上就來了。想想日常生活的例子。在中國，地鐵上外放影片很常見。在台灣，比較少看到。在日本，社會規範強到你不上靜音，反而顯得失禮。所以問題是：這裡被優先保護的自由，到底是誰的？一旦你開始問這個問題，後面的問題只會更難。安樂死算不算自由？擁槍權算不算自由？自由主義不會直接給你答案，它只會逼你面對選擇背後的代價。接著把精英主義放進來看。精英主義認為，獎勵應該依照能力與成就分配，聽起來也很公平。但有一句話你可以慢慢想：「如果你真的相信人應得成功，那你其實也相信人應得苦難。」這不是情緒性的批評，而是一個邏輯推論。這就帶我們走向平等的問題。自由主義制度強調形式上的平等：規則一樣、競爭開放、不看背景。但當人一出生就擁有不同的經濟、社會、文化資本時，這樣的平等真的合理嗎？布赫迪厄會提醒我們，忽視差異，並不會消除不平等，只會讓它看起來比較「自然」。再來看共產主義與社會主義。理論上，社會主義是通往共產主義烏托邦的過渡階段。在共產主義裡，沒有自由市場，因為競爭會製造不平等；金錢失去意義，人人平等——至少在理論上是這樣。許多國家都自稱如此，但是否真的符合這個理想，是另一個問題。我們用一個很實際的例子來看意識形態怎麼落地：稅制。瑞典的所得稅高達六、七成。台灣最高約三成，而且多數人繳得更少。但台灣政府並不窮，因為有營業稅、消費稅、國營或半國營企業、以及高關稅。這些都不是自然現象，而是政治選擇。談到民主，我們也常犯一個錯誤：把它當成「有或沒有」。比較好的方式，是把民主看成一組面向：選舉、言論自由、行動自由、關係自由。而且這些自由，永遠都有界線。德國禁止納粹言論，中國透過戶籍制度限制移動。沒有任何制度是完全不畫線的。最後談發展主義。經濟優先，其餘延後。台灣、南韓、新加坡、香港都走過這條路，而且在經濟上非常成功。但問題來了：民主，能不能等到大家吃飽之後再說？有人認為可以，因為沒有國家能力的民主很脆弱。也有人認為，一旦延後，民主可能永遠不會來。即使中產階級出現，也不保證民主化會發生。財富本身不會推動政治，人會。希望你之後再聽到「自由」、「平等」、「民主」這些詞的時候，能多停一秒。問的不是它們好不好聽，而是——是誰在定義，又是在什麼情境下定義的。`

                title_en: "Order Before Democracy",
                title_zh: "第四週：民主之前的秩序",
                content_en: `Week 4 – Order Before Democracy, and the Weight of History. Alright, this week, I want to start from something that looks like a coincidence—but probably isn’t. When we talk about the so-called Little Four Dragons in Asia, we notice a set of striking similarities. First, they were all developing states. Second, in their early stages, they did not embrace free trade. They closed their doors. Third—and this matters more than people like to admit—they were all former colonies. In Asia, only Thailand was never colonized. Everyone else has a colonial history somewhere in the background. After World War II, most of these places gained independence. But here’s the part that tends to surprise students: independence did not automatically lead to democracy. In fact, many countries quickly moved into military dictatorships. So if independence doesn’t guarantee democracy, what does development actually require? Let’s take Taiwan in the 1950s to 1970s as an example. The political language of that period constantly emphasized self-strengthening and restoration. But think about this carefully: a healthy country that feels secure does not constantly talk about restoration. You only talk about restoring something when you believe something has been lost. This also helps explain why the early KMT focused so strongly on cultural legitimacy. Competing with the CCP, they emphasized “Chinese culture” rather than Taiwanese culture—not just culturally, but politically. Now let’s step back and talk theory. Political development is often discussed through four key components: order, development, culture, and identity. Order comes first. Order means the ability of a country to operate stably, to manage conflict through rules rather than force. Samuel Huntington put it bluntly in 1968: the most important political requirement of developing countries is political order, not democracy. This is uncomfortable for many people to hear. But Huntington’s argument is simple: when social and economic change moves faster than political institutions, instability follows. Development, then, is not just about GDP growth. It’s about whether institutions can actually keep up with change. Culture shapes how people understand authority, obedience, and legitimacy. And identity—who belongs, who doesn’t—often becomes political precisely when institutions are weak. Now, how do we explain development paths? Modernization theory tells a very optimistic story: once the middle class gets rich, democracy will follow. History suggests this is far too linear. In some cases, rising middle classes prefer stability, not political risk. Dependency theory and world-systems theory remind us that countries do not develop in isolation. Colonial history creates resentment, but also structural dependence. Where you sit in the global system—core, semi-periphery, or periphery—shapes your options. Then there’s the developmental state model. Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong—none were fully democratic in their early stages. The state intervened heavily in markets. Growth was prioritized. Yes, this creates rent-seeking space—but corruption is a risk, not a destiny. Huntington’s view is very domestic-centric. He argues that once political institutions become sufficiently institutionalized, democracy becomes possible—even likely. But he largely ignores external forces. Taiwan’s democratization in the 1980s wasn’t just about the middle class. It also involved U.S. pressure, Cold War geopolitics, and shifting international norms. Later thinkers like Fukuyama move the discussion forward, pointing to multipolarity, identity crises, and colonial legacies as ongoing forces shaping political stability today. So here’s where I’ll pause. When you look at Taiwan today, are we mainly facing an identity struggle—or something deeper about institutions and order? And when you look at China, is stability the outcome of legitimacy, fear, performance—or all three? These are not questions with clean answers.

                content_zh: `第 4 週：民主之前的秩序，以及歷史留下的重量。這一週，我想從一個看起來像巧合、但其實很可能不是巧合的地方開始。當我們談亞洲四小龍時，很快就會發現，它們之間有一些非常一致的特徵。第一，它們全部都是發展中國家。第二，在發展初期，它們幾乎都沒有選擇自由貿易，而是關起門來發展。第三，也是最常被忽略的一點——它們全部都有殖民經驗。在亞洲，唯一沒有被殖民過的國家是泰國。其他國家，多多少少都被捲進過帝國主義的歷史。二戰後，這些國家陸續獨立。但很多人會在這裡產生一個錯誤期待：獨立等於民主。事實恰恰相反，許多國家在獨立後，很快進入軍事獨裁或高度威權體制。這就逼我們回頭問一個問題：如果獨立不保證民主，那政治發展到底需要什麼？以 1950 到 1970 年代的台灣為例。那個時代的政治語言，反覆強調「自強」與「復興」。但仔細想想，一個自信、穩定的國家，並不會天天提醒自己要復興。只有當你覺得某些東西失去了，復興才會變成政治口號。這也能幫助我們理解，為什麼早期國民黨如此強調文化正統性。在與中共競爭的過程中，他們選擇強調「中華文化」，而不是台灣文化——這不是單純的文化選擇，而是政治策略。接著，我們把視角拉回理論。政治發展常被拆成四個關鍵要素：秩序、發展、文化、身份認同。秩序排在第一位。秩序指的是國家能否穩定運作、用制度而非暴力處理衝突。杭廷頓在 1968 年說得很直接：發展中國家最重要的政治需求，不是民主，而是政治秩序。這句話讓很多人不舒服，但他的邏輯其實很清楚。當社會與經濟變遷跑得比政治制度快，混亂就會出現。發展，不只是 GDP 成長，而是制度能不能跟上變化。文化影響人們如何看待權威與服從。而身份認同，往往在制度薄弱時，才會變成尖銳的政治問題。那麼，我們該怎麼解釋不同國家的發展路徑？現代化理論給了一個非常樂觀、線性的答案：中產階級變有錢，民主自然會來。但歷史告訴我們，事情沒有這麼簡單。有些中產階級，反而更害怕不穩定。依賴理論與世界體系理論提醒我們，國家不是在真空中發展的。殖民歷史留下的不只是怨恨，也留下結構性的限制。你在全球體系中的位置，會影響你能做什麼選擇。發展型國家的經驗也很關鍵。早期的台灣、南韓、新加坡、香港，都不是高度民主國家。政府深度介入市場，經濟優先。這樣的體制確實創造尋租空間，但那是風險，不是必然結果。杭廷頓的觀點非常內生導向。他相信，只要制度化程度夠高，民主就會變得可能。但他幾乎不處理外在因素。台灣 1980 年代的民主化，並不只是中產階級壯大的結果，也與美國壓力、冷戰結構、國際規範轉變密切相關。後來像 Fukuyama 這樣的學者，開始把視野放大，討論多極化、身份政治，以及殖民遺產如何持續影響當代政治穩定。所以，這一週我不打算替你總結答案。我只想留兩個問題給你。你怎麼理解今天台灣的政治拉扯——它主要是身份認同的問題，還是制度與秩序的問題？而中國的穩定，又是來自合法性、恐懼、績效，還是三者混合？政治發展從來不是直線。歷史也從來沒有離開，它只是暫時沉默。`

                content_en: `Alright, let’s talk about Taiwan — and no, not in the simplistic “it just became democratic” kind of story. If democratization were driven by a single factor, political scientists would be out of a job. Taiwan is a textbook case precisely because it forces us to abandon monocausal explanations. What happened here was the result of several forces moving at the same time, sometimes reinforcing each other, sometimes creating pressure from different directions. First, we have to go back to the Japanese colonial period. Japan left behind a high-capacity bureaucratic structure, infrastructure, and a degree of social modernization. This didn’t make Taiwan democratic — but it created a state that could actually function. Second, geopolitics matters more than we like to admit. In 1987, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution urging democratic reform in Taiwan. This was Cold War strategy. But external pressure still counts, and for authoritarian regimes dependent on international legitimacy, it matters. Third, and this is where Taiwanese society enters the picture: democracy was demanded, repeatedly. Social movements accumulated. KMT versus non-KMT forces reflected a deeper struggle over political participation and rights. Over time, this normalized democratic expectations. Now here’s the uncomfortable comparison. In 1989, China faced a similar moment. The key difference? Political elites. Chiang Ching-kuo did not choose violent repression. Instead, he encouraged younger generations to enter politics. Many scholars argue that without the Tiananmen crackdown, China’s political trajectory might look very different today. So no, Taiwan’s democratization cannot be reduced to culture, leadership, or foreign influence alone. It was interaction — not intention — that mattered. This brings us to historical narrative. Look at how history is taught. In Hong Kong textbooks, the 228 Incident becomes an “unpleasant episode.” Tiananmen is renamed “Political Turmoil between Spring and Summer of 1989.” Authoritarian power doesn’t only silence people; it rewrites memory. Finally, two concepts help us make sense of Taiwan’s situation. Abnormality: in most countries, citizens don’t wake up wondering whether their identity is a national security issue. Taiwan does. Ambiguity: paradoxically, this lack of clear sovereignty has allowed Taiwan to continue operating as the ROC under a relatively democratic system. So here’s the real question I’ll leave you with: Is ambiguity a weakness — or has it been Taiwan’s greatest political resource?`,
                content_zh: `好，我們來談台灣。但我先說清楚，如果你期待一個「因為人民很努力所以民主化成功」的故事，那今天你會失望。如果民主化真的只靠單一因素解釋，政治學這門學科早就可以收起來了。台灣之所以重要，正是因為它迫使我們放棄單因論。民主不是某一天被「決定」的，而是多股力量在不同時間點彼此推擠、交錯，最後形成結果。第一個因素，我們必須回到日本殖民時期。日本留下的是一套高效的官僚體系、基礎建設與現代化社會結構。這不等於民主，但它創造了一個「能運作的國家機器」。而歷史告訴我們，沒有國家能力，民主往往活不久。第二，地緣政治不可忽視。1987 年，美國眾議院通過決議，要求台灣進行民主改革。這是不是出於道德關懷？坦白說，不是，這是冷戰邏輯。但對高度依賴國際支持的威權政權來說，外部壓力就是現實成本。第三，台灣社會本身的力量。民主不是一次性的運動，而是反覆累積的要求。國民黨與非國民黨的對抗，不只是政黨競爭，而是關於誰能參與政治、誰有發聲權。久而久之，民主成為一種「理所當然的期待」。接著，我們必須面對一個不舒服的比較：1989 年的中國。當時的歷史窗口其實存在，關鍵差異在於政治菁英的選擇。蔣經國沒有選擇暴力鎮壓，反而鼓勵年輕世代進入政治。許多學者認為，如果天安門沒有走向血腥結局，中國今天的政治樣貌可能完全不同。所以，台灣的民主化不是文化的奇蹟、不是領袖的恩賜、也不是美國單方面推動的結果，而是多重因素互動的產物。這也解釋了為什麼「歷史敘事」如此關鍵。在香港課本裡，二二八變成「不愉快的事件」，天安門被稱為「1989 年春夏之交的政治風波」。威權不只封口，它還改寫你怎麼記得。最後是身份認同。中國人還是台灣人？身份來自個人經驗、世代記憶與外部影響。今天，中國的軟實力——TikTok、小紅書、媒體敘事——實際上正參與這個認同塑造的過程。兩個概念可以幫助我們理解台灣：異常性：多數國家的公民不需要每天思考自己的身份是否牽涉國安，台灣卻必須。模糊性：正因為主權未被釘死，台灣反而得以在 ROC 名義下，維持一套相對民主的制度。所以，我想問的不是「台灣是不是正常國家」，而是——這種模糊，到底是風險，還是台灣最成功的政治策略？`

                content_en: `Let’s start with a term Beijing has been very fond of recently: “two shores, four places.” By grouping Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan together, Beijing is asserting a hierarchy. The question is who gets to define the relationship. Now, Hong Kong and Macau are both Special Administrative Regions under “One Country, Two Systems,” but analytically, they are very different cases. Both were colonial territories. What matters here is the institutional legacies they left behind. Hong Kong relied on administrative discipline. The British constructed a highly institutionalized bureaucracy emphasizing rule of law and market freedom — but with very limited political participation. Macau followed a different path. Stability there was maintained less through formal institutions and more through relationships — informal networks among Chinese elites and Catholic organizations. Both models delivered something very important: prosperity without democracy. Hong Kong became a global financial hub; Macau developed into a casino economy. In both cases, we see authoritarian prosperity. The obvious question is: can this last? Economic growth creates a middle class, and a middle class tends to ask uncomfortable questions. The real breaking point comes when trust collapses. This is where authoritarianism and developmentalism intersect. Developmental states prioritize growth first, rights later. Deng Xiaoping famously pointed to Singapore as a model. Taiwan under martial law followed a similar logic. “One Country, Two Systems” was designed to preserve prosperity while minimizing disruption. High autonomy, separate legal systems, capitalism within socialism. In practice, autonomy is conditional. The 2020 National Security Law made that clear. Hong Kong’s transformation — from an autonomous global financial city to one increasingly aligned with Beijing — shows us the limits of asymmetrical power. Hong Kong was never a political city. Its success was built on political apathy. Some now blame younger generations for “politicizing” Hong Kong. It reflects a developmentalist mindset: politics is seen as disruption. But the structural reality is: Hong Kong is not in a federal system. It operates under centralized authority. Beijing retains the final authority to define democracy, autonomy, and stability. So the question is no longer why Hong Kong changed. The real question is: could it have stayed the same under this structure?`,
                content_zh: `我們先從一個北京近年來很喜歡用的詞開始：「兩岸四地」。這個詞聽起來中性、技術性，甚至有點行政語言的味道，但我要提醒你們——政治語言從來不只是描述現實，而是在建構現實。把中國大陸、香港、澳門和台灣放在同一個框架裡，重點不是它們是否彼此連結，而是：誰有權力定義這種連結是什麼樣子。香港與澳門同為「一國兩制」下的特別行政區，但從政治發展的角度來看，它們其實是兩種非常不同的案例。兩者都曾是殖民地。關鍵不在殖民者是誰，而在於他們留下了什麼樣的制度遺產。香港靠的是行政紀律。英國建立了一套高度制度化的官僚體系，強調法治、治理效率與市場自由，但政治參與被嚴格限制。澳門走的是另一條路。它的穩定更多來自人際關係而非正式制度——依靠華人菁英與天主教機構的非正式網絡，是一種社區導向而非法治導向的模式。但不論哪一種路徑，兩者都達成了一件事：沒有民主的繁榮。香港成為全球金融中心與自由港；澳門則發展出以賭博與觀光為核心、並深度依附中國大陸的經濟結構。這就是我們所說的「威權式繁榮」。那問題來了：這樣的繁榮能撐多久？經濟成長會催生中產階級，而中產階級遲早會開始問一些政府不太想回答的問題。真正的斷裂點，往往出現在權力開始被濫用、信任開始瓦解的時刻。這正是威權主義與發展主義交會的地方。發展主義強調「先發展、後權利」。鄧小平曾公開稱新加坡為典範。認同不只是結構問題，更來自個人經驗。一國兩制的設計初衷，是在不劇烈動盪的情況下維持繁榮。理論上，這套設計相當優雅。但現實是：自治是有條件的。2020 年的國安法清楚劃出了界線。香港從一個高度自治的全球金融自由港，逐漸轉向與北京更緊密對齊的城市，正好揭示了不對等權力關係的極限。香港從來不是一座政治城市，而是一座經濟城市。它的成功建立在政治冷漠之上。當年輕世代開始政治化，有人將動盪歸咎於他們。它反映的是一種發展主義思維：政治等於干擾。但結構事實是：香港並不處於聯邦體制之中，而是在高度中央集權下運作。北京始終握有最終詮釋民主、自治與穩定的權力。所以，問題其實不是「香港為什麼變了」，而是——在這樣的制度結構下，它真的有可能不變嗎？`

Remember the whole Peking vs. Beijing naming debate? And the 1971 UN seat showdown? Basically a global popularity contest with huge stakes: who gets to say, “I am China.” But here’s the real core: it’s all about the CCP staying in power. One Party, one dictatorship, and everything else – ideology, policy, propaganda – is just a tool to make that happen. Think about the Party-State setup: the Party is above the state. It holds the gun – the military – and the pen – propaganda. And ideology? Flexible. You bend it depending on what the situation demands. Let’s look at three leaders. Mao, Deng, Xi. Same goal, very different roads. Mao: “Stand up!” Focus on class struggle, mobilization, Cultural Revolution… unified the country politically, but the economy? Total collapse. Deng: “Get rich!” Pragmatism. Reform and Opening Up, 1978. Don’t talk politics, watch GDP. Result: saved the Party, got prosperity… no democracy, though. Xi: “Get strong!” Nationalism and patriotism. Great Rejuvenation. Wolf Warrior diplomacy – looks outward, but really speaking to the domestic audience to consolidate power. And China’s not out of challenges. Demographics: low birth rate, gender imbalance, limited immigration. Economy: middle-income trap, efficiency problems from state-capitalism mix. Geopolitics: trade wars, tech bans, Belt and Road backlash. So, takeaways? China is adaptive. Tools change, ideology flexes, but survival of the Party remains the constant. And that, my friends, is the PRC in a nutshell.`,

Today, we’re trial-ing to take a step back and see the bigger picture: what has this course really taught us? If we had to summarize in one sentence, it’s this: Political development is about how countries navigate order, culture, development, and identity to find a political path that works for them. It’s rarely linear. From the Asian Tigers, we learned about developmental states and how history and geopolitical positions shape outcomes. Taiwan’s democratization showed us that change comes from an interplay of colonial legacy, external pressure, social movements, and elite choices. Hong Kong and Macau reminded us that the relationship between economic prosperity and political freedom is complex and always being tested by social consciousness. Finally, the case of China illustrates the logic of political survival and the constant adaptation to internal and external challenges. In summary, this course gives us three key takeaways: 1. Political development is the result of multiple interacting factors. 2. Order and development often take precedence over democracy in early stages. 3. External environments and historical contexts deeply influence political trajectories. So next time you analyze political development, remember: there’s no universal model. Only by understanding context can we truly grasp a country’s political journey. Thank you for listening, and good luck with your future thinking!`,
